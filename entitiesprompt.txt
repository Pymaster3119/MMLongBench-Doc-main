Image -> minimal JSON output.

Tasks:
- One-sentence summary (<=25 words).
- Extract ALL canonical entities visible or clearly implied.

Output rules: JSON ONLY. No prose, no Markdown.

Exact schema (order required):
{
  "summary": "<one-sentence summary, <= 25 words>",
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "<canonical name or phrase>",
      "type": "<Person|Organization|Location|Event|Topic|Object|Date|Other>",
      "description": "<concise role or relevance, <= 12 words>"
    }
  ]
}

Short rules:
- Include all meaningful entities; do not cap results.
- Use canonical names; merge variants.
- Prefer multi-word when informative; normalize dates.
- Description <=12 words; include implied entities when clear.
- Output must be a single JSON object with "summary" then "entities".
